aaaddaaddasdasdasdasdasdas finance minister on Tuesday, tasking his close party colleague with reviving investment in an economy that has been growing at its slowest rate in a decade.

Jaitley, 61, will also lead the defense ministry as well as corporate affairs, the government said in a statement on Modi's cabinet that was sworn in on Monday.

Modi campaigned on a promise to cut bureaucratic sloth and fight corruption. Analysts say Modi's huge election victory gives him the mandate to advance reforms that stalled under the previous Congress-led, scandal-ridden administration of his predecessor, Manmohan Singh.

One of the top corporate lawyers in the country, Jaitley served as a commerce minister in a previous government of the Bharatiya Janata Party.

A day after his inauguration, Modi was due to meet Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who was among regional leaders invited to the ceremony, amid hopes of a thaw in ties between the two nuclear-armed countries.

Modi named BJP veteran Sushma Swaraj as foreign minister. The Hindu nationalist BJP has long advocated tough positions on national security and Pakistan, in particular.
